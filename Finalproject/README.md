# Final Cockroach Microbiome Project Report

**Author**: Muhtarin Khayer Brohee  
**Course**: PLPA-6820  
**Date**: `r Sys.Date()`  
**Project Title**: Microbial Diversity and Composition in the Gut of *Periplaneta americana*

---

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes metagenomic data from the gut microbiome of male and female American cockroaches (*Periplaneta americana*) using taxonomic profiles generated by Kraken2.

We constructed presence-absence matrices and genus-level abundance tables, calculated species richness, performed group comparisons, and visualized top genera with heatmaps.

The entire pipeline is fully reproducible and documented in an R Markdown file.

##  Data Description

- **Input Data**: Kraken2 report files (`*_kraken_report.txt`)
- **Samples**: 10 samples, 5 male and 5 female cockroaches
- **Sequencing**: Shotgun metagenomics (unmapped read classification)
